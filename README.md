# 🚑 Smart Movable Road Divider for Ambulance Path Optimization

A smart system designed to **automatically detect ambulances in traffic** and **shift the road divider in real-time**, creating a clear lane for emergency vehicles to pass through. This project leverages AI and IoT to reduce emergency response time in urban traffic scenarios.

## 📌 Project Introduction

This project is a **Smart Movable Road Divider for Ambulance Path Optimization**, specifically designed for **emergency vehicles** like ambulances. In dense traffic situations, ambulances often get stuck, risking lives due to delayed medical attention. This system **detects an ambulance using a YOLOv8-based object detection model** and shifts the road divider automatically to make way for it, using a servo motor mechanism. 

It is an IoT-based solution integrated with computer vision to provide real-time lane clearance without manual intervention.
